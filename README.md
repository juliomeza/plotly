## Overview of Project
Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.

- The dashboard has the demographic information on the left with a drop-down menu that allow us to select any volunteer.
- In the middle, we have a 'Bar Chart' to display the top 10 bacterial species in the volunteer belly buttons. This will help the company identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.
- On the right we have a 'Gauge Chart' to indicate the number of scrubs per week, from 0 to 10.
- At the bottom, we have a 'Bible Chart' to display the bacterial cultures per sample. The greater the bubble, the greater the bacterial cultures.
